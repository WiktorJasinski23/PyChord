## Short description of the idea
The main issue of the project is to harmonize and rhythmize given melodic line, using machine learning. The user may expext a little own-composed music piece based on their own melody, with added rhythm and full chords (harmonic sets of pitches consisting of multiple notes, heard simultaneously) that match all these.

## Features:
- nice user interface that allows the user to put in their own melody like the piano 
- radomization of nice, logical and natural rhythm to be a basis for chords creation
- output in the form of audible music piece and guitar/piano chords
- using machine-learning to teach the program to match chords correctly
- web application 

## Tools:
- django
- mingus package
