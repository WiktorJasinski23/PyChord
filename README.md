## Short description of the idea
The main issue of the project is to harmonize and rhytm-ize given melodic line, using machine learning. The user may expext a little own-composed music piece based on their own melody, with added rhythm and full chords (harmonic sets of pitches consisting of multiple notes, heard simultaneously) that match all these.
